    An elegant home of mountain modern design exemplifying the fusion of the
    clean crisp linear look of a very modern design into a mountainous
    environment. Soaring expanse of glass and natural reclaimed wood allows the
    homeowner the open living environment sought after by most of today's
    homebuyers. Additionally, many very private spaces are incorporated within
    the design for the separation of lifestyles for each person of the family's
    individual requirements. There is even a safe room incorporated in the home
    for the safety of the family. Simply stated, an amazing statement of the
    homeowners lifestyle and status statement.
