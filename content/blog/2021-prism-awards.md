We are elated to share with you all that our team received TWO Houston’s Best PRISM Awards this year!

Our first award is the “Best High Performance and Energy Efficient Home” and the second is the highly-coveted “Best Custom Home Outdoor Living Space” award. We are so very proud and grateful for the recognition we’ve received through the years from our industry peers. The Greater Houston Builders Association, who organizes the Houston’s Best PRISM Awards each year, is the largest builders association in Texas and the third largest in the country. Thank you GHBA!

#### BEST HIGH PERFORMANCE ENERGY EFFICIENT HOME

This home is the first residential building in Fort Bend County to earn a LEED Platinum certification!

Compared to a traditionally-constructed house, this home has been designed and constructed in ways that use fewer resources, reduce waste, minimize negative environmental impacts, decrease life cycle costs, and will lead to better health and productivity of the homeowners. While we use many similar green building methods and materials on all of our homes, we are especially proud of the additional effort contributed by all to get this home to LEED Platinum status. To provide a frame of reference, there are less than 8,500 buildings IN THE WORLD that have achieved this highest sustainability certification! Be sure to check out our previous blog post for details about what went into the energy efficient design and construction of this home.

#### BEST CUSTOM HOME OUTDOOR LIVING SPACE

This home features a fully climatized outdoor living space that can be enjoyed year-round! Making this Loggia fully conditioned and climate-controlled with modern sliding glass doors to the pool allows this to function as a true indoor/outdoor space. You can check out our previous blog post here for more details on the design and construction of this home.
