What an exciting project this recently completed renovation was! First, a little background: Several years ago, we built a custom home for a pair of homeowners who were an absolute joy to work with. They had been settled into their new home for quite some time but hadnâ€™t yet decided what to do with their old home. Then, they called us up and asked us to completely redesign and renovate it for them. And what a transformation it was!!! Everything, from the exterior skin of the home to each inch of interior was updated. A guest suite was even added to the first level of the home.

We are so proud of this whole-home renovation, and so impressed with the homeowner and her daughter for making every interior design decision themselves. Quite an accomplishment!
