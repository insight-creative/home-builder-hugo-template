For most of us, the past year has ushered in a strong desire to update and optimize our living spaces. If you’re hoping to embark on a home renovation in the near future, here are 10 ways to make your home look and feel a bit more “custom.”

### Custom Built-Ins

Custom built-in cabinetry is a beautiful (and functional!) go-to for upgrading your home. A talented trim carpenter with experience in custom homebuilding can build bookshelves, TV cabinetry, desks, closets, a butler’s pantry, etc. that perfectly fit your space and add a bespoke feel to your home. The most common spaces that our homeowners often opt for a large, custom built-in piece in is their Living Room, Study, and Game Room.

Updated Staircase

Oftentimes, the staircase is situated prominently in a home, which makes it especially primed for a high-impact upgrade. Instead of the builder-standard staircase, consider updating yours with a fresh railing, new coat of stain or paint, trimmed or tiled risers, or a unique runner. If you’re looking for an even more dramatic change, consider adding trim detailing and a rich color to your stair hall.

### New (and Consistent) Trim

Peruse inspiration photos to determine what style of trim you like, and update all of your baseboards, crown molding, and door/window trim to match. Updating ALL of this trim detailing in your home will appear as though it was designed and built custom rather than “builder-basic” or even semi-custom.

### Solid-Core Interior Doors

Replace your hollow core doors with 1.75-inch solid core doors. Not only do they have a weightier, higher quality feel to them, but you can also customize the paneling (or lack thereof) to better match your updated style. While you’re at it, be sure to upgrade your door hardware as well!

### Wall Detailing

Infusing your own personal taste and desired aesthetic into your home goes a long way towards giving it a custom look and feel. Injecting your personality into the design of your walls through custom paneling, plaster, fresh wallpaper, or unique paint colors are all great ways to customize your walls. Say goodbye to “builder beige!”

### Ceiling Detailing

Along the same vein as wall detailing, ceiling detailing can enhance the custom feel of your home. Thankfully, this doesn’t have to be a huge or expensive undertaking. Consider adding solid or boxed beams, tongue & groove paneling, unique trim detailing, or a paint color that complements your walls. When combined with other design elements in a few key spaces, ceiling detailing can help create a cohesive, custom design where it matters most.

### Updated Bathrooms

Unlike the previous couple of ideas, this suggestion isn’t very easy OR inexpensive. BUT it is often very worth it! If the layout of your bathrooms already function well, then focus on just updating the finishes (lighting, cabinetry/storage, countertops, plumbing fixtures, and tile). Fortunately, there is a wide variety of good-looking finish selection options out there that won’t break the bank. Just be sure that the overall design for each bathroom is fresh and cohesive before investing the time and money required for this update.

### Floor Inlays

Incorporating an inlay in your flooring is typically an item that you tack on to a larger renovation. It’s rarely done as a stand-alone project. Working an inlaid design into a foyer, hallway, or room helps with defining a space, transitioning from one space to another, or simply making a design statement in the home.

### Update your Lighting

Lighting is often overlooked in production or semi-custom homes. Beyond the regular mix of recessed cans and basic hanging fixtures, there is so much to consider when creating a renovation lighting plan for your home. Thinking about your specific lighting preferences is a good place to start: Do you and your family prefer warmer or cooler light? Overhead lighting (recessed cans) or indirect lighting (lamp lighting, directional wall lighting)? Pendants or chandeliers or sconces? Other options like a lighting control system, dimmer switches, or art wall lighting can also create a truly custom lighting plan for your home.

### Updated Kitchens

Updating your kitchen is arguably the most important item on this list. Without renovating your kitchen, other updates you make won’t really elevate your home to a truly “custom” look or feel. Be sure to update your kitchen to enhance both form and function, making sure that it works well for your family’s daily life AND that it reflects your personal style in a current, cohesive way.

We hope this article has helped get your creative juices flowing! A few strategic choices as you embark on a home renovation journey can help elevate your home to achieve a truly custom look and feel. Happy renovating!
