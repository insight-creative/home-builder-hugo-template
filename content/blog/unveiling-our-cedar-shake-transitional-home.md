We are so pleased and proud to share photography of our new Cedar Shake Transitional home with you! This architecturally unique home in Tanglewood was designed by the homeowner, a talented Houston-based commercial architect. His exterior vision for the home incorporated steel windows, Cedar shake siding, a Cedar shingle roof, and the meticulous execution of board-form concrete walls. The board-form concrete is visible from the outside and inside, and as such was strategically integrated throughout the home's exterior and interior design. We take great pride that the homeowner trusted our team to execute these architectural details he so thoughtfully designed for his family's home.
